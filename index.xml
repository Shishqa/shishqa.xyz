TOSCA - (not an opera) - Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications, is an OASIS standard language to describe a topology of cloud based web services, their components, relationships, and the processes that manage them.
The project is now at Proof of concept stage. I&amp;rsquo;ve developed a TOSCA profile for describing a configurable Kubernetes topology, which can be already used to deploy a Kubernetes cluster.</description></item><item><title>links</title><link>http://example.org/links/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/links/</guid><description> github: @Shishqa linkedin: @shishqa email: shishqa.main@gmail.com telegram: @shishqa</description></item><item><title>markdown test</title><link>http://example.org/log/markdown-test/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/log/markdown-test/</guid><description>Overview Philosophy Block Elements Paragraphs and Line Breaks Headers Blockquotes Lists Code Blocks Span Elements Links Emphasis Code Note: This document is itself written using Markdown; you can see the source for it by adding &amp;lsquo;.text&amp;rsquo; to the URL.
Overview Philosophy Markdown is intended to be as easy-to-read and easy-to-write as is feasible.
Readability, however, is emphasized above all else. A Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it&amp;rsquo;s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions.</description></item><item><title>Mikhail Shishatskiy</title><link>http://example.org/whoami/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>http://example.org/whoami/</guid><description>Experience Cloud Research assistant Ivannikov Institute for System Programming of the RAS July 2021 &amp;mdash; now
