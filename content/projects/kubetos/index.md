  Yet another way to deploy Kubernetes
  (but promising)
---

Aim of this project is to try implementing Kubernetes deployment framework (like Kubespray) with TOSCA standard

> **TOSCA** - (not an opera) - Topology and Orchestration Specification for Cloud Applications, is an OASIS standard language to describe a topology of cloud based web services, their components, relationships, and the processes that manage them.

The project is now at **Proof of concept** stage. I've developed a TOSCA profile for describing a configurable Kubernetes topology, which can be [already used](https://github.com/Shishqa/kubetos) to deploy a Kubernetes cluster.

The main stopper is that xOpera orchestrator (on which I relied at an early stage) does not support substitution mapping and therefore the described cluster description cannot be decomposed into reusable parts.

Now I am working on implementing substitution mapping inside the custom orchestrating system...
